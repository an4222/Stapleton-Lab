PLINK Tips
All information can be found at http://zzz.bwh.harvard.edu/plink/data.shtml
These are my highlights

	use the --out option to name your files, then you can use --rerun to rerun a previous job and only have to type edits
	you can use --ped and --map for marking ped/map files
	binary files are easier for PLINK to digest, so converting may help runtime
The first six columns of a PED file should be as follows:
	 Family ID
     Individual ID
     Paternal ID
     Maternal ID
     Sex (1=male; 2=female; other=unknown)
     Phenotype
MAP files should contain exactly four columns:
	 chromosome (1-22, X, Y or 0 if unplaced)
     rs# or snp identifier
     Genetic distance (morgans)
     Base-pair position (bp units)
You can use PLINK to make bed/bim/fam files
	plink --file mydata --out newname --make-bed
examples, additionally, if you leave out the --out option, it will default the data to plink.bed/plind.bim...
