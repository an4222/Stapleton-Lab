Spring 2018 Worklog:

vQTL Projects:
	Random/Family Manching:
		rerun with consistant code
	Mutiple Stress Manching:
		add stresses as if they were sex data then run vQTL
	namRIL Howell Data:
		Correctly format with Z values

Start and complete qPCR assignment in 1.12.18 folder
Try running Rand vQTL through Stampede2, get better time estimate 1 hr is too short
	Once the Rand vQTL is through again, get QTL values for Rand and continue with BioMercator

Worked with Byrd on planning out the rest of the g x e project
submit SLURM file for vQTL for Random + Family, and Manching Multiple stress
Talk to Stapleton and continue figuring out specifics of g x e project
find bnlearn book online and start reading it
Random + Family SLURM error seems to be in dglm fit, with something about no nonnegative numbers for gamma dists

1/19/18
Talk with Byrd and Stapleton about all the details of g x e simulation
Make and rewrite our plot of how to go about the simulations
begin exploratory data analysis for how to best model these distributions

1/23/18
Begin working on TASSEL/ Howell Project with Dave Hiltbrand
Begin getting Howell Data ready to be read as a cross for vQTL
big issue with finding loci for all the markers. We have site names but need incremental positions
