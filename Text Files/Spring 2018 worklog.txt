Start and complete qPCR assignment in 1.12.18 folder
Try running Rand vQTL through Stampede2, get better time estimate 1 hr is too short

Worked with Byrd on planning out the rest of the g x e project
submit SLURM file for vQTL for Random + Family, and Manching Multiple stress
Talk to Stapleton and continue figuring out specifics of g x e project
find bnlearn book online and start reading it
Random + Family SLURM error seems to be in dglm fit, with something about no nonnegative numbers for gamma dists
