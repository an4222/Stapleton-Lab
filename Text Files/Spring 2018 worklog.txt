Spring 2018 Worklog:

vQTL Projects:
	Random/Family Manching:
		rerun with consistant code
	Mutiple Stress Manching:
		add stresses as if they were sex data then run vQTL
	namRIL Howell Data:
		Correctly format with Z values

1/16/18

Start and complete qPCR assignment in 1.12.18 folder
Try running Rand vQTL through Stampede2, get better time estimate 1 hr is too short
	Once the Rand vQTL is through again, get QTL values for Rand and continue with BioMercator
	
1/18/18
Worked with Byrd on planning out the rest of the g x e project
submit SLURM file for vQTL for Random + Family, and Manching Multiple stress
Talk to Stapleton and continue figuring out specifics of g x e project
find bnlearn book online and start reading it
Random + Family SLURM error seems to be in dglm fit, with something about no nonnegative numbers for gamma dists

1/19/18
Talk with Byrd and Stapleton about all the details of g x e simulation
Make and rewrite our plot of how to go about the simulations
begin exploratory data analysis for how to best model these distributions

1/23/18
Begin working on TASSEL/ Howell Project with Dave Hiltbrand
Begin getting Howell Data ready to be read as a cross for vQTL
big issue with finding loci for all the markers. We have site names but need incremental positions

1/25/18
Continue prepping Howell cross object
looking for link between site loci and site numbers
come to the conclusion that the loci are the number of basepairs deep into each respective chromosome
Still an issue with forming the cross object

1/30/18
Hopefully final scrubbing for the Howell cross object prep
Tried running vQTL in Stampede, but it was taking an awful long time even just reading in the data
Going to try running it at a SLURM batch job
Had issues with tidyverse package, I realized I wasn't actually using it, so it isn't an issue anymore
Slurm Job submitted and running rest of the day 4+ hours, I only had it for 5 originally, so we'll see if I need to rerun it with more time

2/1/18
Resubmitting Howell vQTL job
In the mean time try getting the Random/Family vQTL running

2/6/18
Howell vQTL ran for 9 hours and error was as follows:
		Error in factor(x = qtl::pull.geno(cross = cross)[, marker.name], labels = genotype.names) :
		invalid 'labels'; length 2 should be 1 or 1 Calls: sapply -> lapply -> FUN -> effect.sizes -> factor
	This is definitely in the effect.sizes function.
	
2/8/18
Scrubbed the Howell Dataset 3 times
	first was to get rid of any non ACTG entries and mark them as N
	second was to translate ACTG into As and Bs with (A,C) as A and (G,T) as Begin
	third was to filter out columns with only two unique entries (likely A and N or B and N)
Finally we submitted another batch job to Stampede2 with the cross object as this new file ("Howell-Cross-ObjectC3.csv")
Additionally, I redid the vQTL code for the Manching Multiple Stress experiment and resubmit it
	first attempt had an issue with the tidyverse package not being installed
	second attempt with install.packages("tidyverse") at the top, but didn't specify a CRAN mirror
I opened an R session and installed the package (took a surprisingly long time)
	third attempt submitted
	
2/13/18
Looking into issue with formula not being correctly read in effect.size function
	It looks like it is an issue with the names being numeric, so I am adding in the character Marker right before each number
Reuploaded new Howell-Cross-ObjectC3.csv to Stampede2 and changed the R code a bit. Resubmitted at 12:06
Looking back at the Manching Multiple Stress dataset
	Seems to be having the same extract vars issue where the program is unable to use the column names in the formula
Letting both jobs keep running

2/15/18
Submit Unspliced Howell to Stapleton
Running Spliced Howell
Also need to do Unspliced/Spliced ratio prediction
New qPCR analysis to do today
qPCR analysis sent to Dr. Stapleton

2/16/18
Submitted Ratio SLURM job, got Spliced data down from Stampede2

2/20/18
Stampede2 is down for maintainence today
I will:
	run some small scale Manching vQTL and make sure the formatting is working correctly
Once Stampede2 is back up:
	check what went wrong with the Howell Ratio vQTL
	Run a better MultipleStress vQTL with the stuff I have tested today
	
It looks like the hyphen that scanonevar is adding is not able to be parsed in the DGLM portion of effect.sizes
I'll write a script that only looks at the original SNPs and see if that changes things

2/22/18
Howell-Ratio had failed because I forgot to change the phenotype in the effect sizes formula
Changed and rerunning in SLURM

Working on Manching in the mean time
For some reason the sample data is producing really weird results, maybe it has to do with the sampling method, so I'm trying it with the full set

While that is running as well, I'm working on the Family/Random and trying to make sure that code works for both sets locally

2/27/18
To-do list:
		Look into issue with only 9 of 10 chromosomes being added in output
		Write up methods in text document
			specifically mention where position numbers came from
			Add A/T or C/G Column to output
