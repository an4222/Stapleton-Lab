from Elena:
		for new data:
		BLUE/GREEN cells : gene of interest
		RED cells : reference gene
		NUMBERS : treatment
		NTC : control
		
	Markings for ratiocalc:
		gs = gene of interest and treatment group
		gc = gene of interest and control group
		rs = reference gene and treatment group
		rc = reference gene and control group
	
		
	Looking for best comparisons
	Testing Fam data:
		gs = A:F 1:9 odd
		gc = G 1:9 odd
		rs = A:H 11 and 12, and H1:H4
		rc = H5:H9
