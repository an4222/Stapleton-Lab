	Reading AlphaSim Documentation
	
5/16
	Called about getting HVAC fixed
	Continue QxPak documentation
	Getting permission denied error accessing QxPak stampede app
	Continue reading AlphaSim Docs
	Reading and updating Example AlphaSim file
	Upload it to Google Drive
	
	Example alphasim job : 8565365730777371111-242ac115-0001-007 submitted @11:15 am
	used AlphaSimEx.json linking to AlphSimExSpec.txt in my Discovery Environment
	Job FAILED. I think because there was not an empty set of parameters
	
	Added in parameters, and new job # 7702303666237805031-242ac115-0001-007 Submitted@11:23 am 
	
	asked Agave API crew about QxPak
	job 7702 still queued at 1:23
	
	Meanwhile,
		Trying to run GEMMA. I can link to a python version via Validate/CurrentReleaseStable/GWAS_1/gemma
		run data with .bed/.bim/.fam data
		used mixed-model analysis. general idea is to use the following format:
		Validate/CurrentReleaseStable/GWAS_1/gemma -bfile inputs/DWBED/dongwang -gk 1 -o output
		
	GenSel specifically prediction
	Decided to disregard GenSel for now
	
5/17
	Working with qpcR package
		got example to work, seems pretty simple to translate to our data
		possible issue with data formatting, idk though
		There seems to be issues with some of the data trials, which are really throwing off some of the models
		Specifically only one or two out of five of the UCN No hormone Fam data seemed to go well
		In the UCN No hormone Hex data, 3 or 4 out of the 5 trials seemed to have gone well
			This is disheartening as this looks like the best set of data we will have
		AlphaSim (7702) still Queued at noon (24+ hours of queue time)
	Working with a mathematical way to rule out outliers in the qpcR data. 
	Current want to work with the KOD function which requires a modlist
	R is taking a long time to generate this modlist

	Job 7702 STILL QUEUED (45+ hours of queue time) 
	I'm going to run it in the development queue to see if I can just have it run at all
	New dev batchQueue job#: 5627905105917252071-242ac115-0001-007 submitted 9:32 am
	job pending at 11:09
	Writing some documentation for the qpcR implementation
	There were too many poor curves in the UCN - NH - Fam data, so they couldn't even be marked as outliers
	However, in the UCN -NH - Hex data, there was only one bad curve, which can actually be marked as an outlier
		I'd like to find some way to normalize the starting points of the curves, to really analyse the differences between them
		as is it seems like we are taking the average of a bunch of similar looking parallel sigmoidal curves
			It seems that there is some error with doing the arithmetically or geometrically adjusted data			
			Both yield:
				Error in qr.default(.swts * attr(rhs, "gradient")) : 
				NA/NaN/Inf in foreign function call (arg 1)	
		I originally thought that this had to do with the zero values in the arithmetically adjusted file, but the error persists in the geometric data
	Stapleton in relation to my qpcR blocks:
		Graphpad prism (odd data input structure) good documentation
		specialty curve fitting funtions, diverse stats tests
		also in R?
		4 vs 5 parameter tests
		indiviually pick best fit curves and compare influetial points (inflection points)
			This is a crude and unscientific method
	Read Material about Departmental Honors and 499, email Dr. Ye about possibility of doing it in the upcoming year
	
5/19
	Checking Jobs @ 9:00am:
	7702 still Queued (70ish hours)
	5627 still Pending (24ish hours)
	
	Dr. Ye says it isn't too late, and to get moving on the Honors Project ASAP
	Email Dr. Wang about it [check]
	
	Prep for Friday stand-up meeting:
		
			qpcR:
				Accomplishments:
					Got qpcR to fit models to data for individual trials well
					Able to verify certain trials are outliers within a series of repetitions
				Blocks:
					The majority of data sets have a majority of trials that never "took off" which makes it impossible to mark them as outliers
					When trying to adjust and normalize data (because a lot of it is parallel) there are errors with assigning weights to adjusted data
					Additionally, when using adjusted data, the trials that were previously marked as outliers no longer are marked
				Going forward:
					Finalize simulated curves, and then begin calculating ratios, there are some good functions for that
					
			Validate:
				Accomplishments:
					Constructed example QxPak JSON
					Decided to mark out GenSel as a GWAS tool due to unavailability of program
					Gained a better understanding of the AlphaSim program by reading documentation
					Ran Gemma locally in Stampede with DongWang data
				Blocks:
					QxPak is listed as a app on Stampede, but it is not accessible at the moment
						I messaged the Agave crew about it, and followed up with mattdotvaughn, but have not gotten a reply
					Unable to interpret Gemma output
				Going Forward:
					Looking for pipeline prototype, trying to run AlphaSim locally, my jobs are taking forever to run
					
Friday 5/19 Meeting notes:
		Stapleton:
			Kickoff meeting for envirotyping week after next
			Organizing face to face meeting
			want's to see people pushing stuff to git
			set up data repo for Stapleton Data
		Ben:
			Going through R packages
			relating to PCR curves, with block covars
			want to start working with data
			figure out science integration with stats
			Stap:
				focus on experimental design
		Yunkai:
			clarifying tasks
			looking into getbio
			Figured out Byrd's question
			paperwork problem
			Need to spend time with Dave to go through Winnow code
			
		Gemma still being worked on, very powerful and flexible, but complicated
		
		Thomas:
			Working on qpcR, issues with data outliers
			trying to assign weights with geometrically adjusted data
			QxPak JSON written, but app not accessible on Stampede
			Trying to get AlphaSim to work with DaveH
		
		Suggs:
			Working on Pipeline with Rest API
			Python connection client with Agave (autogenerated code)
			(Stap) Teach someone else that, write documentation for it (report bugs) Fonner & Stuggs? are the goto people for it
					be careful which channels to message in
		Byrd:
			Helping with pipeline
			how they all work together, how to connect
			trying to ssh into TACC (linux issues)
			Stap: you probably don't need ssh to interact with TACC
					use IRODS with data calls, but the enviroment needs to be set up
					use Agave ToGo, better in the long run
					^ new default, tokens API (not a big deal, but a good thing to learn)
					
		DaveH:
			Looking at AlphaSim
			1.04 on Agave, newest is 1.08
			trying to use GUI for local running, but issues with local running
			wanted to get with Yunkai about it
			
			Stap: I can message the developer group
					There are resources from the developers that can help
					We get to pick which version we want, it would be ideal if the dev could install into Agave for use
					We have to install it for them (lots of back and forth) (similar problems in the UK)
					Ask which version is stable (give the devs time since it;s UK)
					
		Lauren:
			Doing nano drop on extractions
			working on other data
			in contact with lisa to get SNP IDs
			
			Stap: Lisa is sweet, good with questions
			
		Elena:
			Worked with Lauren
			Meeting with professors
			Trying to get website up and running
			Getting dilutions and samples
			Thinking about ordering more optical tubes for samples (do that)
			running low on other tubes
			had a document for Mary to understand curve data
			redo primer dilutions? (they're fine)
				
			Stap: Give me order numbers for orders, bring in experimental bio textbook
					there is a genetics book, has linear algebra for math behind rules/software
					
		General:
		Course of action if you have a problem
		Documentation/Github -> Agave Slack -> Talk to Devs
		Make your own git repo (talk to Thomas about it)			
		
		421 junction is really dangerous, and careful when turning left into the driveway
