	Reading AlphaSim Documentation
	
5/16
	Called about getting HVAC fixed
	Continue QxPak documentation
	Getting permission denied error accessing QxPak stampede app
	Continue reading AlphaSim Docs
	Reading and updating Example AlphaSim file
	Upload it to Google Drive
	
	Example alphasim job : 8565365730777371111-242ac115-0001-007 submitted @11:15 am
	used AlphaSimEx.json linking to AlphSimExSpec.txt in my Discovery Environment
	Job FAILED. I think because there was not an empty set of parameters
	
	Added in parameters, and new job # 7702303666237805031-242ac115-0001-007 Submitted@11:23 am 
	
	asked Agave API crew about QxPak
	job 7702 still queued at 1:23
	
	Meanwhile,
		Trying to run GEMMA. I can link to a python version via Validate/CurrentReleaseStable/GWAS_1/gemma
		run data with .bed/.bim/.fam data
		used mixed-model analysis. general idea is to use the following format:
		Validate/CurrentReleaseStable/GWAS_1/gemma -bfile inputs/DWBED/dongwang -gk 1 -o output
		
	GenSel specifically prediction
	Decided to disregard GenSel for now
	
5/17
	Working with qpcR package
		got example to work, seems pretty simple to translate to our data
		possible issue with data formatting, idk though
		There seems to be issues with some of the data trials, which are really throwing off some of the models
		Specifically only one or two out of five of the UCN No hormone Fam data seemed to go well
		In the UCN No hormone Hex data, 3 or 4 out of the 5 trials seemed to have gone well
			This is disheartening as this looks like the best set of data we will have
		AlphaSim (7702) still Queued at noon (24+ hours of queue time)
	Working with a mathematical way to rule out outliers in the qpcR data. 
	Current want to work with the KOD function which requires a modlist
	R is taking a long time to generate this modlist
	
5/18
	Job 7702 STILL QUEUED (45+ hours of queue time) 
	I'm going to run it in the development queue to see if I can just have it run at all
	New dev batchQueue job#: 5627905105917252071-242ac115-0001-007 submitted 9:32 am
	job pending at 11:09
	Writing some documentation for the qpcR implementation
	There were too many poor curves in the UCN - NH - Fam data, so they couldn't even be marked as outliers
	However, in the UCN -NH - Hex data, there was only one bad curve, which can actually be marked as an outlier
		I'd like to find some way to normalize the starting points of the curves, to really analyse the differences between them
		as is it seems like we are taking the average of a bunch of similar looking parallel sigmoidal curves
			It seems that there is some error with doing the arithmetically or geometrically adjusted data			
			Both yield:
				Error in qr.default(.swts * attr(rhs, "gradient")) : 
				NA/NaN/Inf in foreign function call (arg 1)	
		I originally thought that this had to do with the zero values in the arithmetically adjusted file, but the error persists in the geometric data
	Stapleton in relation to my qpcR blocks:
		Graphpad prism (odd data input structure) good documentation
		specialty curve fitting funtions, diverse stats tests
		also in R?
		4 vs 5 parameter tests
		indiviually pick best fit curves and compare influetial points (inflection points)
			This is a crude and unscientific method
	Read Material about Departmental Honors and 499, email Dr. Ye about possibility of doing it in the upcoming year
	
5/19
	Checking Jobs @ 9:00am:
	7702 still Queued (70ish hours)
	5627 still Pending (24ish hours)
	
	Dr. Ye says it isn't too late, and to get moving on the Honors Project ASAP
	Email Dr. Wang about it [check]
	
	Prep for Friday stand-up meeting:
		
			qpcR:
				Accomplishments:
					Got qpcR to fit models to data for individual trials well
					Able to verify certain trials are outliers within a series of repetitions
				Blocks:
					The majority of data sets have a majority of trials that never "took off" which makes it impossible to mark them as outliers
					When trying to adjust and normalize data (because a lot of it is parallel) there are errors with assigning weights to adjusted data
					Additionally, when using adjusted data, the trials that were previously marked as outliers no longer are marked
				Going forward:
					Finalize simulated curves, and then begin calculating ratios, there are some good functions for that
					
			Validate:
				Accomplishments:
					Constructed example QxPak JSON
					Decided to mark out GenSel as a GWAS tool due to unavailability of program
					Gained a better understanding of the AlphaSim program by reading documentation
					Ran Gemma locally in Stampede with DongWang data
				Blocks:
					QxPak is listed as a app on Stampede, but it is not accessible at the moment
						I messaged the Agave crew about it, and followed up with mattdotvaughn, but have not gotten a reply
					Unable to interpret Gemma output
				Going Forward:
					Looking for pipeline prototype, trying to run AlphaSim locally, my jobs are taking forever to run

			figure out science integration with stats
			Stap:
				focus on experimental design
		Yunkai:
			clarifying tasks
			looking into getbio
			Figured out Byrd's question
			paperwork problem
			Need to spend time with Dave to go through Winnow code
			
		Gemma still being worked on, very powerful and flexible, but complicated
		
		Thomas:
			Working on qpcR, issues with data outliers

			(Stap) Teach someone else that, write documentation for it (report bugs) Fonner & Stuggs? are the goto people for it
					be careful which channels to message in
		Byrd:
			Helping with pipeline
			how they all work together, how to connect
			trying to ssh into TACC (linux issues)
			Stap: you probably don't need ssh to interact with TACC
					use IRODS with data calls, but the enviroment needs to be set up
					use Agave ToGo, better in the long run
					^ new default, tokens API (not a big deal, but a good thing to learn)
					
		DaveH:
			Looking at AlphaSim
			1.04 on Agave, newest is 1.08
			trying to use GUI for local running, but issues with local running
			wanted to get with Yunkai about it
			
			Stap: I can message the developer group
					There are resources from the developers that can help
					We get to pick which version we want, it would be ideal if the dev could install into Agave for use
					We have to install it for them (lots of back and forth) (similar problems in the UK)
					Ask which version is stable (give the devs time since it;s UK)
					
		Lauren:
			Doing nano drop on extractions
			working on other data
			in contact with lisa to get SNP IDs
			
			Stap: Lisa is sweet, good with questions
			
		Elena:
			Worked with Lauren
			Meeting with professors
			Trying to get website up and running
			Getting dilutions and samples
			Thinking about ordering more optical tubes for samples (do that)
			running low on other tubes
			had a document for Mary to understand curve data
			redo primer dilutions? (they're fine)
				
			Stap: Give me order numbers for orders, bring in experimental bio textbook
					there is a genetics book, has linear algebra for math behind rules/software
					
		General:
		Course of action if you have a problem
		Documentation/Github -> Agave Slack -> Talk to Devs
		Make your own git repo (talk to Thomas about it)			
		
		421 junction is really dangerous, and careful when turning left into the driveway
		
5/22/17
	Prep for Monday meeting:
	what are my goals for this week?
		continue PCR curve/ratio analysis
			work on outlier analysis
			work on more data sets
	Get data for 9-11
	Talk to Dr. Wang about setting up 499 project, neural network for mortgage pool predictions?	
	
	7702 job finished, and looks like to ran even though it gave an error stating that the file was incorrectly named
	5627 job still pending in dev queue
	setting up Synapse
	qpcR documentation
		logging when certain trials are considered outliers
		question about astersisks sent to author of package
	Writing a little more documentation about when outliers are marked
	Begin work on (9), Multiple-Stress QTL
	
5/23/17
	Continue emailing Dr. Wang about 499
	Try to interpret the Multiple-Stress QTL discussion section
	(This is also known as the Manching Experiment)
		Try to determing which SNPs determine plant height in across different environments
		adjust for plants with correlated/similar genotypes
		fit model according to enviroment covariates
		environments are structured with single and multiple stress treatments
		Are the same SNPs responsible in different stress environments?
		Additionally, there is variation with physical spacing and its relationship with genetic similarities (LD)
		We can use TPM or haplotype analysis to create P values for this
	Reccommended steps:
		Read Heather's Defense
			Got a general idea of the experimental design
			Seeing how maize reacts to different stresses, and their combinations
			The stresses used were: low nitrogen, low water, and a pathogen
		Read plant height metadata
		Pick GWAS tools 
		
		How do we want to model this?
		Goals: make tidy data, remove lines where the lots failed quality seed control
		how to use measured score phenotype
		Model == Assosciation tests (look for important variables)
		
	Questions:
		What are the Genotype scores?
			Comment about the scores, Y value, not normally distributed, one measurement
			Use as a covariate? 
			always a background level of pathogen, but higher in the applied groups
	Null: The same SNPs effect all the stress factors
	Null: Should see the same features without the presence of stress, whether or not there is other stresses
	
	Created LogCurveGeneration.R to generate logistic functions with known-truth data
		uploaded to github
		
	Look at true and false positive rates with different levels of 
	look at difference between curves, with factorial
	as noise increases, difference has to increase to say powerful

5/24
	Begin researching how much variance is acceptable in my generated models before the tests substantiate the difference
	Clean up qpcR.R file, and merge it with the outlier file into qpcRclean.R
	Wanting to test type I/II error rates in different differences in these curves
	The three variables are as follows(Upper bound, midpoint, and steepness)
	How to test false positive/negative rates:
	
	
	use matrix for filling in equation paramters
	generate stuff with noise, then analyze like they were real data
	dsc2, similar to validate
	Github, in R/python framework
	Tell a story with data. Show how to do it. Learn Python and R, and good applied software engineering
	Enthought, free license have to sign up. Also CodeAcademy
	Julia is a new up and coming language, ease of use with python, and libraries like C
	Juypiter, notebook that lets you run code interactively, with wikiesque flexibility
	
	Began working through codecademy Python, got up to conditionals/console something
	
5/25
	Plan:	Continue working through Python tutorials
			pursue D-1/D-2 forms with the Honors College
			Contact Dr. Wang about statistically determining differences of curves
			Take a stab at beginning (9), outline process
			
		Called Honors College about filling out DH1 forms, will do after I finish my coffee
		In the meantime, I'll continue with the Python tutorial
		Created R file to make logistic curves and replicate them an arbitrary number of times
		
		general advice from fonner(for beginners)
		how do you guys normally do support tickets? (intercom software, etc)
		
5/26
	want to finish/clean up the pcr fits, then working on calculating ratios
	began learning python
	created program to build dataframes of known truth reps 
	odd stuff with not detecting outliers
	submitted DH1 form
	
					sdk = software development kit
	
	Ben write to Robert Cordy (how to access at Chapel Hill in applied stats lab)
	Gabe, work on code review(project review) call out things that seem odd
	Work on documentation when your software is down
	When will we have Validate ready?
	Thomas, write a prescreening function(write a feeder function) 
	
	look for GenSel (obscure) matt vaughn, send a request about it (Fonner) (how to find stuff)
	
	Syngenta -> Association
	Gensel -> Association
	Dong Wang -> Association
	Syngenta Mask -> Prediction
	AlphaSim (missing) -> Prediction
	
5/29
	continue learning Python
	Still having issues with outlier detection, looking into new methods of detection
	Fixed issues with function not running (error with cycle = 0?)
	Found new function mselect() that runs data with all available models, and chooses the best one (very helpful)
	Learned how to use pcrbatch() and began using ratiocalc()
	Better method to show goodness of fit utilizing GOF and only printing the R^2 value
	
5/30
	Waiting for a stand up meeting
	Continue learning Python
	new file for theory behind data analysis
	
5/31
	Continue working with Python tutorials, making good progress
	Email qpcR author concerning error in ratiocalc(). Waiting to hear back about that
	Begin looking into D3 while waiting for response from Andrej
	
6/1
	Finished a few more Python courses
	Still no email from Andrej
	Begin looking back at multiple stress QTL nvm
	Looking into the source code behind ratiocalc
		the expression involves :
			(eff.gc^cp.gc/eff.gs^cp.gs)/(eff.rc^cp.rc/eff.rs^cp.rs)
		I want to check if these are all present in our pcrbatch
		It seems that propagate() is giving us a "try-error" response,
		so I'll look at its source code
		For propagate to give try-error, it has to be unable to take the derivative of the expression
		
6/2
	Continue with Python
	meeting stuff
	
	Friday 6/2/17 Meeting

6/5/17
	Prep for meeting?
	Review more Manching data
	
	Reviewing Manching data, begin looking at how to approach it
	Continue trying to figure out the qpcR package, issue with ratiocalc
	Been going through Elena's data just to look for outliers
	
	Going deeper and trying to run ratiocalc line by line, and getting into propagate line by line yields the following:
	propagate tries to match an expression involving eff.gc, cp.gc etc. to our column names which are Vars, A2, A4 ... H12
	These do not match, so propagate fails
	Going through ratiocalc and propagate, I don't see how the dataframe switches to make new column headers involving these variables
	
	ok, so our normal data is not passed onto the propagate, it's a set called allDAT, which does have those headers
	the issue is that most of the columns are full of null values. Lets see when the effs were calculated in ratiocalc.
	
6/6/17
	Got script trying all possible parameters in ratiocalc to run, and they all failed. :(
	
6/7/17
	Trying to get ratiobatch to run, and encountered the same error with ratiocalc, as it is nested withing ratiobatch :(
	Tried running ratiobatch/calc in R 2.13.0 since that was the original version it was released in, but it still failed :(
	Going to try to rewrite the portion of the function that has the error
		to do this I'll need to read the papers explaining what the function is trying to do
	Tried with a max of 16 in any given category, and it yielded the same error as well
		still doesn't work
	Tried with a max of 16 in one gene gene of interest, and 16 in gene of reference
		same error
	The program runs significantly differenly in R 2.13.0. Is it better to run it in the current version, or the legacy version
	
6/8/17
	Determing error ratio for data (what percent of the cells can not fit a sigmoidal regression?)
		both HEX and FAM data for elena
	Looking over outlier methods with Elena

6/12/17
	Went through all the outlier detection analysis comapared to characteristics of actual curves
	ratiobatch worked for HEX data but not FAM data when set up the same way

6/13/17

6/14/17
	Field Day
6/15/17
	Looking for possible "y-values":
		Efficiency of curves
			efficiencies are calculated in pcrbatch
			find a way to mass pull, and look at them in a good way
		Critical Threshold
			find a way to calculate these values
			pull and analyze them
		Inflection point
			Look for second derivative
		
6/16/17
	Finished with gathering eff data for FAM HEX
	still have to work with the multiplex assays
	Work with Dr. Stapleton on going over data
	Come up with a new way to display the NTC cells (don't show up in log scale charts)
	
	Multiplix assay column numbers:
col: 12,13,	24,25,	36,37,	48,49,	60,61,	72,73,	84,85,	86:94,	96,97
lv:	 3000	300		30		3		3000	300		30		3000,300,30,3,3,3
fluom <- c(12,13,24,5,36,37,48,49,60,61,72,73,84,85,86:94,96,97)
values<- c(3000,3000,300,300,30,30,3,3,3000,3000,300,300,30,30,3000,300,30,3,3,3)

	running into issues with f517 column 85

6/19/17
	seems that we can't get a PCR fit on column 85 (G12 cell)
	yeah, that data looks like a mess
	
6/20/17 - 6/22/17
	Working on getting up to speed with Ben on vQTL

6/23/17
	As far as getting 'P-values' for all the markers
	ultimately we need to run them through makeqtl and fitqtl
		the issue with this is that makeqtl can only take one per chromosome
			additionally, I'm not sure if the models are dependent on the other SNPs used to make the model
			I think they are, but I'll ask Dr. Stapleton
	
6/26/17
	There are 531 SNPs on the 1st chromosomes, and we can only do one SNP per chromosome at a time
	So we need to run 531 fitqtl and makeqtls. I timed how long this took on my computer and it took around 3 minutes to run one
	Extrapolating this, it would take ~ 26 hours to run on my computer. Maybe use one in the DA lab, try to integrate with Stampede?
	start writing script
	
6/27/17
	Finished writing script, and runs in a few minutes
		the output is labeled pval, and it contains the following columns in order:
		SNP name, position (in centiMorgans), pvalue for phenotype significance
		
7/3/17
	Look at documentation for simulated output
		good for testing methods
		
7/10/17
	Continue working through qPCR stuff,
	tidy the data for vQTl and continue troubleshooting why Random.csv doesn't work
	Waiting to hear back about calcPred, but still trying to troubleshoot in the meantime
	
	I will be gone Thursday morning to take Exam P, and gone next week for a family vacation
	
7/14/17
	Been going through vQTL trying to get mean and variance estimates
	Progress on PReMiuM with CalcPredictions
	will continue working on vQTL
	and qPCR data as it becomes available
	check output matrix, look at additive and dominant
	
7/24/17
	issue with loading qtl library before vqtl library
	for mean formula:
	cross$phenotype$yvar ~ 
	
I have gotten the plots to work, and found influential SNPs
	the functions I have written can pick out all SNPs with a certain FWER
	then get their plot and almost output them to a folder
	you can pick between mean, variance or both.
	
	So far I have only been doing it with the Random data, but can also do Family
	Mostly just need to wrap up final outputting issues, and need more computing power
	It took my computer like a day just to run Chromosome 1 for the Random data
	need to run the whole genome for both, and probably run more permutations as well
	Issue with only the last chart showing from a for loop trying to show them all
