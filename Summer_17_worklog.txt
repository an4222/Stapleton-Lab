	Notes:
	Genotype (x-value)
	Phenotype (y-value)
	GWAS looks for coorelations for genetics -> phenotype
	environment would be a COVARIATE here
	(genotype files can be HUGE)
	prediction == genome wide SELECTION

5/12
	Rewriting task objective, subtasks, and needed skills/resources

	(8)
	Get R package
	do simulations (5 parameter curve) - stat heavy
	lots of publications

	Stapleton:
	10-15 min career development plan
	skills have/needed for different projects
	how will it all fit in to your career?
	Lab get together (friday/sunday afternoon?)
	
	Organization:
	Where are the assets going to be? (cyverse/synapse/google drive)
	
	start with known-truth analysis between geno/phenotype
	get them from Stapleton, look at structure/ list (metadata list)
	which apps to run, how to validate which is best app
	also consider computational efficiency
	
	getbio (MB and Kai)
	using docker
	
	
personal:
	working on insightmaker
	learning r packages, read documentation

	Start reading QxPak manual @ http://nce.ads.uga.edu/~ignacy/numpub/blupf90/docs/qxpak.pdf
		notes:
			complimentary to Plink
			useful for Mixed Model Solving, QTL, SNP association
			warnings:	make sure data is space delimited
						0 is read as a missing value. Set true 0s to 0.000001 EXACTLY
			File types:
				Parameter File:
					ML_OPTION (Optional, Values: Y/N, Default:Y)
						Y=Maximal Likelihood method, N= Restricted Maximum Likelihood
					MEMORY_RAM (Optional, Values: Y/N, Default:N)
						Store all data on RAM instead of HD. Does not work of multitrait is defined
					MULTITRAIT_OPTION (Optional, Values: Y/N, Default:N, single trait)
						If yes, the next field must be the number of traits analyzed sequentially
							ex: 12300 sequential traint analayises 
								y 12300
					DATAFILE (Optional, Default: qxpak.dat)
						Specifies name of file containing individual, records, and effects
						first column must be the individual
					OUTFILE (Optional, Default: qxpak.out)
						if append it present, new analyses are added at the end of the existing file
					PEDIGREEFILE (Optional, Default: qxpak.ped)
					MARKERFILE (Optional, Default: qxpak.mkr)
						spec name of file w/ marker info. if keyword "transpose" is written after file name, snps are rows insead of columns
						"transpose" can be written as "t" 
					MARKER_POSITIONS (Needed with QTL)
						name_of_chromosome, positions of each marker in cM
						or
						name_of_chromosome, -number_of_markers (, spacing_in_cM)
						ex: chr77 -100 #100 markers spaced every cM
							chr13 -2000 .05 #2000 markers spaced every 0.05 cM
							or
							chr77 0. 10.13 20.1
					SEX_CHROMOSOME (Obligatory if sex chr included)
						chrx !the whole chr is NRY
						chrw 10 !all markers in position 10 cM assumed to be pseudoautosomal
						chrw -10 !wrong
						
					QTL (Obligatory if any marker effect included)
						which genetic effects should be included in the model.
						spec minimum number of loci to minimize computing. 
						format:
							QTL_name, QTL_type, (segment), Position_specification, (Nested) (Imprinting paternal) (Imprinting maternal)
						long list of qtl types in docs
						dominant only works with certain experimental designs
							two contrastng components (dominant and recessive)
							very specific hypothesis
							haplosufficiency
						additive
							one adds 3, one adds 7 
						epistatis
							interactions between single terms (genotype)
							instead of being fully additive, there exists another interactions
							maybe g1*g2, table of all possibly interactions (49 of them?)
					TRAIT (Obligatory)
						Defines Model for each trait
