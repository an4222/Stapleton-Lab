	Notes:
	Genotype (x-value)
	Phenotype (y-value)
	GWAS looks for coorelations for genetics -> phenotype
	environment would be a COVARIATE here
	(genotype files can be HUGE)
	prediction == genome wide SELECTION

	(8)
	Get R package
	do simulations (5 parameter curve) - stat heavy
	lots of publications

	Stapleton:
	10-15 min career development plan
	skills have/needed for different projects
	how will it all fit in to your career?
	Lab get together (friday/sunday afternoon?)
	
	Organization:
	Where are the assets going to be? (cyverse/synapse/google drive)
	
	start with known-truth analysis between geno/phenotype
	get them from Stapleton, look at structure/ list (metadata list)
	which apps to run, how to validate which is best app
	also consider computational efficiency
