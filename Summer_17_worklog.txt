		notes:
			complimentary to Plink
			useful for Mixed Model Solving, QTL, SNP association
			warnings:	make sure data is space delimited
						0 is read as a missing value. Set true 0s to 0.000001 EXACTLY
			File types:
				Parameter File:
					ML_OPTION (Optional, Values: Y/N, Default:Y)
						Y=Maximal Likelihood method, N= Restricted Maximum Likelihood
					MEMORY_RAM (Optional, Values: Y/N, Default:N)
						Store all data on RAM instead of HD. Does not work of multitrait is defined
					MULTITRAIT_OPTION (Optional, Values: Y/N, Default:N, single trait)
						If yes, the next field must be the number of traits analyzed sequentially
							ex: 12300 sequential traint analayises 
								y 12300
					DATAFILE (Optional, Default: qxpak.dat)
						Specifies name of file containing individual, records, and effects
						first column must be the individual
					OUTFILE (Optional, Default: qxpak.out)
						if append it present, new analyses are added at the end of the existing file
					PEDIGREEFILE (Optional, Default: qxpak.ped)
					MARKERFILE (Optional, Default: qxpak.mkr)
						spec name of file w/ marker info. if keyword "transpose" is written after file name, snps are rows insead of columns
						"transpose" can be written as "t" 
					MARKER_POSITIONS (Needed with QTL)
						name_of_chromosome, positions of each marker in cM
						or
						name_of_chromosome, -number_of_markers (, spacing_in_cM)
						ex: chr77 -100 #100 markers spaced every cM
							chr13 -2000 .05 #2000 markers spaced every 0.05 cM
							or
							chr77 0. 10.13 20.1
					SEX_CHROMOSOME (Obligatory if sex chr included)
						chrx !the whole chr is NRY
						chrw 10 !all markers in position 10 cM assumed to be pseudoautosomal
						chrw -10 !wrong
						
					QTL (Obligatory if any marker effect included)
						which genetic effects should be included in the model.
						spec minimum number of loci to minimize computing. 
						format:
							QTL_name, QTL_type, (segment), Position_specification, (Nested) (Imprinting paternal) (Imprinting maternal)
						long list of qtl types in docs
						dominant only works with certain experimental designs
							two contrastng components (dominant and recessive)
							very specific hypothesis
							haplosufficiency
						additive
							one adds 3, one adds 7 
						epistatis
							interactions between single terms (genotype)
							instead of being fully additive, there exists another interactions
							maybe g1*g2, table of all possibly interactions (49 of them?)
					TRAIT (Obligatory)
						Defines Model for each trait

	Example alphasim job : 8565365730777371111-242ac115-0001-007 submitted @11:15 am
	used AlphaSimEx.json linking to AlphSimExSpec.txt in my Discovery Environment
	Job FAILED. I think because there was not an empty set of parameters
	
	Added in parameters, and new job # 7702303666237805031-242ac115-0001-007 Submitted@11:23 am 
	
	asked Agave API crew about QxPak
	job 7702 still queued at 1:23
	
	Meanwhile,
		Trying to run GEMMA. I can link to a python version via Validate/CurrentReleaseStable/GWAS_1/gemma
		run data with .bed/.bim/.fam data
		used mixed-model analysis. general idea is to use the following format:
		Validate/CurrentReleaseStable/GWAS_1/gemma -bfile inputs/DWBED/dongwang -gk 1 -o output
		
	GenSel specifically prediction
	Decided to disregard GenSel for now
	
5/17
	Working with qpcR package
		got example to work, seems pretty simple to translate to our data
		possible issue with data formatting, idk though
		There seems to be issues with some of the data trials, which are really throwing off some of the models
		Specifically only one or two out of five of the UCN No hormone Fam data seemed to go well
		In the UCN No hormone Hex data, 3 or 4 out of the 5 trials seemed to have gone well
			This is disheartening as this looks like the best set of data we will have
		AlphaSim (7702) still Queued at noon (24+ hours of queue time)
	Working with a mathematical way to rule out outliers in the qpcR data. 
	Current want to work with the KOD function which requires a modlist
	R is taking a long time to generate this modlist

	Job 7702 STILL QUEUED (45+ hours of queue time) 
	I'm going to run it in the development queue to see if I can just have it run at all
	New dev batchQueue job#: 5627905105917252071-242ac115-0001-007 submitted 9:32 am
	job pending at 11:09
	Writing some documentation for the qpcR implementation
	There were too many poor curves in the UCN - NH - Fam data, so they couldn't even be marked as outliers
	However, in the UCN -NH - Hex data, there was only one bad curve, which can actually be marked as an outlier
		I'd like to find some way to normalize the starting points of the curves, to really analyse the differences between them
		as is it seems like we are taking the average of a bunch of similar looking parallel sigmoidal curves
			It seems that there is some error with doing the arithmetically or geometrically adjusted data			
			Both yield:
				Error in qr.default(.swts * attr(rhs, "gradient")) : 
				NA/NaN/Inf in foreign function call (arg 1)	
		I originally thought that this had to do with the zero values in the arithmetically adjusted file, but the error persists in the geometric data
	
	Graphpad prism (odd data input structure) good documentation
	specialty curve fitting funtions, diverse stats tests
	also in R?
	4 vs 5 parameter tests
	indiviually pick best fit curves and compare influetial points (inflection points)
	
	Read Material about Departmental Honors and 499, email Dr. Ye about possibility of doing it in the upcoming year
