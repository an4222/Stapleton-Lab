Friday 5/19 Meeting notes:
		Stapleton:
			Kickoff meeting for envirotyping week after next
			Organizing face to face meeting
			want's to see people pushing stuff to git
			set up data repo for Stapleton Data
		Ben:
			Going through R packages
			relating to PCR curves, with block covars
			want to start working with data
			figure out science integration with stats
			Stap:
				focus on experimental design
		Yunkai:
			clarifying tasks
			looking into getbio
			Figured out Byrd's question
			paperwork problem
			Need to spend time with Dave to go through Winnow code
			
		Gemma still being worked on, very powerful and flexible, but complicated
		
		Thomas:
			Working on qpcR, issues with data outliers
			trying to assign weights with geometrically adjusted data
			QxPak JSON written, but app not accessible on Stampede
			Trying to get AlphaSim to work with DaveH
		
		Suggs:
			Working on Pipeline with Rest API
			Python connection client with Agave (autogenerated code)
			(Stap) Teach someone else that, write documentation for it (report bugs) Fonner & Stuggs? are the goto people for it
					be careful which channels to message in
		Byrd:
			Helping with pipeline
			how they all work together, how to connect
			trying to ssh into TACC (linux issues)
			Stap: you probably don't need ssh to interact with TACC
					use IRODS with data calls, but the enviroment needs to be set up
					use Agave ToGo, better in the long run
					^ new default, tokens API (not a big deal, but a good thing to learn)
					
		DaveH:
			Looking at AlphaSim
			1.04 on Agave, newest is 1.08
			trying to use GUI for local running, but issues with local running
			wanted to get with Yunkai about it
			
			Stap: I can message the developer group
					There are resources from the developers that can help
					We get to pick which version we want, it would be ideal if the dev could install into Agave for use
					We have to install it for them (lots of back and forth) (similar problems in the UK)
					Ask which version is stable (give the devs time since it;s UK)
					
		Lauren:
			Doing nano drop on extractions
			working on other data
			in contact with lisa to get SNP IDs
			
			Stap: Lisa is sweet, good with questions
			
		Elena:
			Worked with Lauren
			Meeting with professors
			Trying to get website up and running
			Getting dilutions and samples
			Thinking about ordering more optical tubes for samples (do that)
			running low on other tubes
			had a document for Mary to understand curve data
			redo primer dilutions? (they're fine)
				
			Stap: Give me order numbers for orders, bring in experimental bio textbook
					there is a genetics book, has linear algebra for math behind rules/software
					
		General:
		Course of action if you have a problem
		Documentation/Github -> Agave Slack -> Talk to Devs
		Make your own git repo (talk to Thomas about it)			
		
		421 junction is really dangerous, and careful when turning left into the driveway
