Stapleton:
	Data Science Students having a poster session 7/24 we could participate
		eventually put it into a powerpoint (34*46ish to print at Honors)
		can also do one for hyperspectral imaging analysis
		
	
Austin:
	Created list with API for relevant functions
		have inputs for phenotypes and number of generations
	Maybe have different types of breeding simulations within one insight
		Document how you would teach others to learn the API
	No communication from Sylvia
		will be switching universities
	
Gabe:
	going through videos for scikit learn
	specifically going through spectranom plugin
		go through documentation for linking to spectranom software
	Pull data from servers -> spectranom and run with machine learning -> apply method to other pictures
	iRODS is max speed for internet, still slower than a wire
Suggs:
	Worked with Ruddell for scikit machin learning
		trying to parse int,float,string variables
		assign categories, compare floats
	want to try XGBoost, or random forest
		every function has the ability to output a score (accuracy)
		there is a package from scikit that looks for total error (different)
		once you find ones that give good predictors, check individually and try ensembling
		2 kinds of labels (steric acid measurements only have 58) and (genotype,density,nitrogen, which we have more of)
		start with 58 rows, compactified
		first improve what we pull out of the image, then add those to our set
		metadata explains what the column headers mean
	Validate is running right now, we'll see how it goes	
		check with austin
Ruddell:
	using polynomial we have 100% accuracy, but probably overfit
		parsing into smaller datasets to cross validate, but hard to do with data sets that are already small
		effect of genotype may depend on other labels
			dealing with this interaction is hard to do in statistics
	machine learning straight from the data is good
		possible follow up, do I need IR, or is visible light ok? (stuff like that)
	
Thomas:
	Been working through qPCR analysis while we are waiting from Sylvia
	Also working with Dave Hiltbrand, and helping him look over his app
		having two people look over it is good
	
Byrd:
	going through the video series
		visualizes with an iPython notebook
		been reading through that to skip video
	looking into machine learning with Suggs
	going through the csv
		your data has all features (only 58 rows)
			for the rest we have phenotype, density, regulator treatment
		for now start with this csv
		how was it created?
	be careful about using integers as labels, regression might take it into account
	
On Monday talk about career development meetings for the upcoming week
