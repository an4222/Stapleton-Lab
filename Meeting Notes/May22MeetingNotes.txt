	Monday Meeting Notes 5/22:
	Stap:
		Get everyone's github, get added to cyverse/validate page
		decide on a data repo for all data being used (some will only be working with cyverse)
			you can use cyverse or synapse or thingshare (synapse seems the best)
		doing grant review Wed/Th, out of town after that, available by slack after Wednesday
		Question: What is the goal for when DW data will be predicted/associated what is the timeline?
	Elena: 
		signing up for something
		something about dilutions
	Lauren:
		get all SNPs figured out
		contact whoever needs to be contacted
		practice assay with genetics materials (in genetics lab) (have reagents organized)
	Dave:
		Reccommend using 1.08 instead of 1.04 (might as well update)
		Learn how to update app on Agave, (copy and paste most of it) why doesn't spec sheet run on 1.08
		why isn't demonstrate running in R (use another type of plot/table)
		what kind of graphics are good for demonstrating True/false positives
	Austin:
		found package for breeding language
		now has to run github data, then start breaking it down and reworking it
		Stap can put you in contact with the boss of the project
		normal problem, why docker is very popular
	Byrd:
		finish pipeline
		get Suggs up to speed with getbio
		learn how to use Agave ToGo
	Suggs:
		Good GWAS interactions
		get to demonstrate locally
		getbio stuff (hopeful
	Thomas:
		Continue working on PCR simulation/ begin calculating ratios
		get data for tasks 9-11 on board (that involves sharing data through synapse)
		Talking with Dr. Wang about 499 for the upcoming year
	Ben:
		Using QTL package (similar to VQTL)
		use data sets given to Ben/Austin with the package
		Stap: have you looked at the alternative package (in slack), they have a repo & R code
		couldn't find R code (will be sent it by Stap)
	
	Going to be using synapse for sharing data
	Gao is putting on computational tutorials 1-3, maybe using horizons to replace TealWare
