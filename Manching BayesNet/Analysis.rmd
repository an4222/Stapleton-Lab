##Reading in Data and Loading Libraries
We are reading in the initial data that we scrubbed from the Manching Multiple Stress Experiment. Addtionally, we are loading the require packages for this analysis.

```{r Data Read include = FALSE}
library("bnlearn")
dat = read.csv(file = url("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tbillman/Stapleton-Lab/master/Manching%20BayesNet/ManchingScrubbed.csv"))
dat = dat[3:dim(dat)[1],]
```

```{r}
which(dat$Height > 100)
dat$Height[which(dat$Height > 100)] = c(48,76,69,56)
unique(dat$Height)
```
##Exploratory Analysis
```{r}
#Overall mean height
mean(dat$Height)
```
