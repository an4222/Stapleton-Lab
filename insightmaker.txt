InsightMaker notes:

General workflow:
	Conceptualize the model
	
	Diagram the model in IM
	
	Add equations
	
	Run and observe results
	
	check results and update for validity
	
Types of primitives:
	Stock:
		"Bucket" that holds a population (has inflows and outflows)
	Variable:
		Contains a variable that does not have flows with other primitives
	Converter:
		Adding empirical or historical data to IM
	States:
		An "on/off switch" boolean/mathematical/depending on other primitives
	Transitions:
		Transitions:Flows::States:Stock triggers lengths of time/probability/condition
	Actions:
		Like triggers for ABM used to move agent/change primitive value/add a connection etc.
